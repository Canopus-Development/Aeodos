# Aeodos Monitoring Guide

## Overview
Monitoring ensures Aeodos remains healthy and performant under various loads. This guide outlines key metrics, tools, and best practices.

## Logging Strategy
- Use structured logs with JSON or logfmt.
- Store logs in a central service (e.g., ELK stack).
- Tag logs with request IDs for traceability.

## Metrics Collection
- Track request throughput, latency, error rates.
- Use Python libraries like `prometheus_client`.
- Visualize in Grafana or other dashboards.

## Health Checks
- Implement liveness and readiness probes for container orchestration.
- Expose a `/health` endpoint returning service status.

## Alerting & Notifications
- Set threshold alerts (CPU usage, memory, response time).
- Integrate with Slack or email for incident notifications.
- Use on-call rotation for critical alerts.

## Tracing
- Distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) can help diagnose performance bottlenecks.
- Trace requests through AI engine, DB, and cache layers.

## Best Practices
- Instrument code to measure function-level performance.
- Monitor AI usage and track any model-related errors.
- Regularly review logs and metrics to optimize.
