# Aoede Security Documentation

## Overview
Security in Aoede protects user data, offers safe APIs, and ensures compliance.

## Authentication & Authorization
- API keys for secure endpoints.
- JWT tokens for user sessions (optional).
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Data Protection
- Store secrets/keys in environment variables.
- Hash sensitive data (API keys) using Argon2.
- Strict SQLAlchemy queries with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.

## Network Security
- Enforce HTTPS at the load balancer or reverse proxy.
- Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to trusted domains only.
- Use WAF or Cloud Security for further protection.

## Secure Coding Practices
- Validate user inputs.
- Implement linting and static analysis.
- Keep dependencies up to date.

## Incident Response
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
- Rotate keys regularly.
- Have a clear policy for reporting vulnerabilities:
  - Email: security@canopus.software

## Additional Measures
- Regular security scans with tools like OWASP ZAP.
- Penetration testing on staging or QA environments.
- Comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).
